# Solve Equations in Finite Field

## Description

This is a small program written in Mathematica that solves a system of equations in a finite field.

The equations must have the form of an ideal, that is, if you have:

	X^2 + Y^2 = 2
	X*Y - 1 = Y

the function solveGF will accept the system of equations as follows:

	{X^2 + Y^2 - 2, X*Y - 1 - Y}
